# Hungriness
Small mobile application to measure hungriness level during the day.

## How it would probably work
During the day, the application sends notifications that lead to the application itself. The application's main screen contains a slider that shows a hungriness level at the moment. After a few days, it is possible to see statistics on levels of hungriness and some recommendations for eating habits.

## Possible application design
